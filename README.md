## Welcome to my mini blog!

Here I will be talking about some of my experiences that have really influenced me or shaped me into a better (or more experienced) person today. 

Hopefully you can learn from my lessons, or be inspired to partake in some of the opportunties that I have discovered over my time in university and also as a tech student in general. 

### Hack the North

Recently, I went to Hack the North for the first time!

As a student at the University of Waterloo, a lot of people asked me: "Have you ever gone to to Hack the North?"
Surprisingly, although I was an avid hacker, I had never had the chance to attend my own university's hackathon, until this year, from September 13-15th 2019. 

Not to toot my own university's horn, but I was really impressed. 
Why? Here's a brief overview:

```markdown

1. Really well organized
2. Friendly and really outgoing volunteers/organizers
3. A lot of passion 

```
So...what did I make?

Our team made a mobile application called PokeBank! We wanted to try out a few APIs that a bunch of companies were offering, to get used to using RESTful APIs as well as get to know some of the amazing sponsors and mentors we met over the weekend.

Our ultimate idea was to create banking more fun and accessible for college students. 
As a college student myself, I sometimes lose track of my finances and forget to save up. This means that I'll be losing a lot more money than ideal, which is worse for me because I have no income during my school semesters. 

Through pokebank, students can easily bank by using a voice command, and get a reward everytime they do so! By having these 'collectibles', students have an incentive to bank more and check in with their savings. 

Not only this, but the team created a segment where the students can also set up goals for themselves. For instance, I might say that I want to only spend 100 dollars a month on groceries. The app will keep track of this goal then remind the user of how much they have spent and how to achieve their goal!

Hack the North was a blast. I got to learn a lot of new technologies that I had never touched before, and meet some intelligent mentors. It was a tiring--but heck of a learning experience.

### PennApps

I was really scared to go to PennApps. 

As the original 'college hackathon', I had high expectations. At the same time, Pennsylvannia is quite far (11 hour bus ride!) from Waterloo, so it was going to be a long journey. I was with a few of my friends who were first-time hackers, and I was scared that they would be left disappointed.

The hackathon didn't turn out the way I expected, but not necessarily in a negative way. Here's some of my takeaways. 

```markdown

1. Workshops
2. People
3. ...People

```

The reason I love going to hackathons is usually because of the amazing people. 

Building something is always so much fun, and a huge learning experience. The swag I can get from these events is awesome. But nothing will come close to the people I get to meet at these events. 

I can always make my own projects in my own time, but I can't meet people from different countries, schools, and disciplines in one space so easily. Hackathons have always been the hot spot to meet some passionate individuals who I've clicked with instantly, becoming my friends of a life-time as well as my network. 

PennApps was my first hackathon outside of the country, so I was able to meet some really fun students from schools in the United States. Not only were we able to share each other's cultures, but we were able to talk about our own experiences from different internships, companies, and schools. 

If you're a little shy (STEM stereotype, but often true), but would love to expand your horizons and meet some new people, go to hackathons. It's a good excuse to make friends, and everyone will be excited to share their 'nerd' part with you. 

### Hack the 6ix

Hack the 6ix is a hackathon in Toronto of a pretty good scale. This was actually the first hackathon I ever attended in 2018, and I was lucky enough to go again in 2019. It was a lot of reminiscing, appreciating, and enjoying. 

Last year, I teamed with some random students who I had never met before. I can safely say that I still keep in touch with them--just kidding, they're actually a few of my closest friends now. 

This year, I mixed it a little bit and grouped with a few of my friends from university. We match perfectly, and our chemistry can get kind of out of hand which leaves us a little distracted at times, but nonetheless, we have a great time. 

After hours of debating on what to do, we wanted to fight an issue that is pounding with importance: the environment.
We did this all by creating an application called GlassWings.

We wanted to create a platform where any user, regardless of their property and income, could share what kind of insurance they bought based on the environmental factors of their property. Afterwards, GlassWings would predict the type of insurance and cost based on the user's location, and use real-time data from actual users. 

We made a web application called Glass Wings.
