## Welcome to my mini blog!

Here I will be talking about some of my experiences that have really influenced me or shaped me into a better (or more experienced) person today. 

Hopefully you can learn from my lessons, or be inspired to partake in some of the opportunties that I have discovered over my time in university and also as a tech student in general. 

### Hack the North

Recently, I went to Hack the North for the first time!

```markdown
As a student at the University of Waterloo, a lot of people asked me: "Did you go to Hack the North?"
Surprisingly, although I was an avid hacker, I had never had the chance to attend my own university's hackathon, until this year.

Not to toot my own university's horn, but I was really impressed. 
Why? Here's a brief overview:

1. Really well organized
2. Friendly and really outgoing volunteers/organizers
3. A lot of passion

### PennApps

I was really scared to go to PennApps. 

As the original 'college hackathon', I had high expectations. At the same time, Pennsylvannia is quite far (11 hour bus ride!) from Waterloo, so it was going to be a long journey. I was with a few of my friends who were first-time hackers, and I was scared that they would be left disappointed.

The hackathon didn't turn out the way I expected, but not necessarily in a negative way. Here's some of my takeaways. 


### Square Code Camp
